Output SAM
==========

The output is formatted in the SAM format.

The first lines starting with @ signs are the header.  The @SQ header gives
the names of the reference sequences and their lengths, the rest of the
headers is not very interesting.

The header is followed by records, each record consists of tab-separated
values.  There are 11 mandatory columns. We give descriptions for the
interesting ones:

 1  QNAME  Name of the query, is ${target_seq_name}_${start}_${end}.
 2  FLAG   See below.
 3  RNAME  Name of matching reference sequence.
 4  POS    Position of match in reference sequence.
 5  MAPQ   -
 6  CIGAR  String describing alignment (see below).
 7  RNEXT  -
 8  PNEXT  -
 9  TLEN   -
10  SEQ    Query segment, cut from forward strand in target.
11  QUAL   -

Interesting FLAG values are:

 0  Alignment fund on forward strand in host.
 4  Alignment found on reverse strand in host.
16  No alignment for this fragment.

The CIGAR string describes an alignment.  For example, the string
3=1X4=1I3=4D3= is read as:

  3=  3 matches
  1X  1 mismatch
  4=  4 matches
  1I  1 insertion with respect to reference sequence.
  3=  3 matches
  4D  4 deletions with respect to reference sequence.
  3=  3 matches

The alignment could look as follows:

  AAAAAAAA-AAAAAAAAAA
  ||| |||| |||    |||
  AAACAAAACAAA----AAA

The mandatory columns are followed by tags, each tag consists of a two-letter
identifier, followed by a ':', followed by its value.

The following tags are used, we only print tags for aligned records.

 * NM -- Edit distance to reference.
 * NH -- Number of hits for this read reported (i.e. with best distance).
 * XC -- Number of errors in the two center quarters of a read.
 * XD -- If 0 then the read is enabled, if 1 then the read was disabled.
